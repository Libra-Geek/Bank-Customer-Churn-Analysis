# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
A deep dive into bank customer data to understand why customers leave and how data-driven insights can help improve retention.

In this project, I aimed to understand and predict customer churn for a bank by analyzing and preparing customer data. The main business goal was to identify the key factors that lead customers to leave the bank, which could then help in developing strategies to retain them.

To achieve this, I started by cleaning the raw data, handling missing values, and removing inconsistencies. I merged multiple datasets to get a comprehensive view of each customerâ€™s behavior, focusing on features like account balance, income, and tenure. Additionally, I engineered new features such as the balance-to-income ratio to capture more nuanced financial behaviors.

I used data visualizations to explore patterns and differences between customers who stayed and those who churned, providing clear insights into which features might influence churn. Through boxplots, barplots, and histograms, I was able to reveal trends such as age groups and financial habits that were more likely to be associated with churn.

Ultimately, this data preparation and analysis helped lay the groundwork for building a predictive model, allowing the bank to identify at-risk customers more effectively. By understanding the characteristics of customers likely to leave, the bank can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and retention.
